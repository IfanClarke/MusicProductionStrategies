# MusicProductionStrategies
I'm brand new to coding but I have been a music producer for 6 years and am well aware of how easy it is to get stuck in the process of making a track. This is inspired by Brian Eno
and Peter Schmidt's 1975 card deck Oblique Strategies which provides a creative block in order to help creatives think laterally and solve issues. In my version there are specific tips for helping with electronic music production in terms of how to arrange, what elements to add in and the order of elements in which to build the track. A button returns a random tip. Coded in HTML with internal JavaScript.
